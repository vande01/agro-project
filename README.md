## Precision Plant Watering System

**Overview**

This Arduino project is designed to create a precise system for monitoring and watering plants based on weight measurements. By utilizing a high-precision NAU7802 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) chip, we can accurately track changes in a plant's weight over time. When the plant reaches a predefined dry weight threshold, a watering mechanism (not included in this basic implementation) can be triggered to provide the necessary hydration.

**Key Features:**

Accurate Weight Measurement: Employing the NAU7802 ADC for highly precise weight readings.
Real-time Monitoring: Continuous tracking of plant weight and display on an OLED screen.
Automated Watering: Trigger a watering mechanism based on weight thresholds.
Configurable Settings: Customizable LDO voltage, gain, and conversion rate for optimal performance.
Calibration Routine: Built-in calibration for enhanced accuracy.

**Hardware:**

Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano)
NAU7802 Precision ADC
OLED Display (I2C interface)
Load Cell or Weight Sensor
Relay or Solenoid (for controlling water valve, not included)

**Software:**

Arduino IDE
Adafruit_NAU7802 library
U8g2lib library
