Precision Plant Watering System

This project aims to develop a smart plant watering system that utilizes a high-precision analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to monitor plant weight and automate the watering process. By continuously tracking changes in plant weight, the system can precisely determine when a plant needs water, optimizing water usage and promoting healthier plant growth. This approach minimizes the risk of overwatering or underwatering, leading to improved plant health and reduced water waste.
